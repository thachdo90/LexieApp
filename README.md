### 1. General Info
This app supports language acquisition by giving teachers and students a platform to better interact with reading passages.
Teachers do this by: 
* Creating short reading assignments with a pre-generated glossary
* Reviewing the reports of each assignment to see student interactions

Students do this by: 
* Reading the assignment and adding unfamiliar words to their personal glossary
* Writing a summary before submitting the assignment
* Review new vocabulary with flashcards
